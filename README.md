Dev Log Antonio Enriquez:

Project: MindCare

Goals for the documented session

 Research how Bootstrap grid system works for responsive design

 Apply Bootstrap containers, rows, and columns in the prototype

 Contribute to the design of one section of the website

 Ensure consistency in colors and layout

Tasks Completed

Investigated Bootstrap documentation to understand the grid system.

Learned how to use container, row, and col-md for layouts.

Helped design part of the prototype by applying Bootstrap to structure sections.

Suggested layout improvements for better responsiveness.

Use of Gen AI

Tool used: ChatGPT

Purpose: Asked specific questions about Bootstrap syntax and best practices.

Example Prompt: “How do I use Bootstrap grid system to make a two-column layout?”

Reflection: It clarified concepts faster than just reading documentation, but I still verified everything in the official Bootstrap docs.

What I Learned

How Bootstrap helps build responsive websites without writing too much custom CSS.

The difference between containers (container vs container-fluid).

How columns resize depending on screen width using breakpoints (col-md, col-lg).

The importance of consistency in spacing and alignment.

Challenges & Bugs

❌ At first, I struggled to understand how columns stack on smaller screens.
✅ Solved it by testing different breakpoints (col-12, col-md-6) in practice.

❌ Unsure about when to use rows vs. just columns.
✅ Fixed it by checking Bootstrap examples and asking for clarification.

Resources Used

Bootstrap Documentation

Class slides and notes on responsive design

ChatGPT for clarifying Bootstrap concepts

Next Steps

Keep improving the layout of specific sections.

Add placeholder content (text, icons, or images) for testing responsiveness.

Work with the team to unify the color palette and card designs.

Explore Bootstrap components (navbar, buttons, cards) for potential use.

Personal Reflection

Today I focused on learning Bootstrap and applying it to our prototype. At first, it felt a bit confusing, but once I practiced, I saw how powerful it is for creating responsive layouts quickly. Contributing to the design of the prototype helped me understand how theory translates into practice. Using AI for small doubts saved me time, but I made sure to really understand Bootstrap by checking the official docs. I feel more confident about working with Bootstrap in future sessions.

Dev Log: Gael Rodriguez:

When we started this project, I worked on building the base structure of our website. I created the HTML skeleton, set up the main sections and made sure everything had a clear and organized layout.
I also implemented the header with navigation and the footer, so users can move easily between sections and understand the purpose of the page. For the content, I made reusable cards for the breathing exercises and daily tips, which helps keep the design consistent and clean.
Even though my main focus was the base structure, I’m excited to explore other parts of the project, like improving the interface and adding dynamic elements.

Dev Log: Diego Arias:
When we were looking for what to do I investigated what proper things we could add to the page. 
Our page is focused on Mind Care, that's why the name. Some of the most important things that we considered to apply in our page was a home page that has elements that can guide you to some exercises, such as breathing, tips and some resources you can navigate in that helps you. This is the navigation part.
Once you scroll down you get to see those spaces that I was talking about. We decided to use blue and green colors as subtle as we could that reflects peace, calm, related to breathing and oxygen. These colors are used in the text and we use withe to have a calm ambience once you enter our page.
I was assigned to research and design the interface of our page. I’ve focused more on working on that part of the project, but I also want to get into exploring other aspects, such as the internal structure of the skeleton of our program.

Goals for the documented session

 Create the base structure of the website using HTML5

 Apply Bootstrap grid system for a responsive layout

 Organize files properly with an external CSS file

 Define a consistent design style and reusable elements (cards, sections)

 Assign roles among team members (research, design, structure)

Tasks Completed

Use of Gen AI

Tool used: ChatGPT

Purpose: Clarify technical doubts while working with Bootstrap and responsive design.

Example Prompt: “What is the difference between container and container-fluid in Bootstrap?”

Reflection: It helped resolve doubts quickly, but most of the work was developed directly by the team.

What We Learned

How to use Bootstrap’s grid system to make the site responsive.

The benefits of separating CSS into an external file for organization.

How to design reusable sections like cards for tips or exercises.

Importance of a consistent layout for user experience.

Challenges & Bugs

❌ Some confusion about how breakpoints (col-md, col-lg) affected layout.
✅ Resolved by experimenting and checking official documentation.

❌ Unsure if images should already be included at this prototype stage.
✅ Decided to leave placeholders and focus on layout first.

Resources Used

Bootstrap Documentation

Class notes on HTML5 and CSS basics

ChatGPT for clarifying Bootstrap concepts

Next Steps

Add placeholder images/icons in certain sections.

Finalize text content for tips and exercises.

Improve color palette and typography for better aesthetics.

Explore Bootstrap components such as navbars, buttons, and cards.

Group Reflection

“As a team, we feel that we have established a solid foundation for the project. Everyone contributed by focusing on their assigned tasks, and the prototype is starting to take shape. Bootstrap seemed confusing at first, but by collaborating, checking documentation, and resolving doubts, we were able to make progress. We are confident about refining the design in the upcoming sessions.”
