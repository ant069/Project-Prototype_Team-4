Project: MindCare

Goals for the documented session

 Research how Bootstrap grid system works for responsive design

 Apply Bootstrap containers, rows, and columns in the prototype

 Contribute to the design of one section of the website

 Ensure consistency in colors and layout

Tasks Completed

Investigated Bootstrap documentation to understand the grid system.

Learned how to use container, row, and col-md for layouts.

Helped design part of the prototype by applying Bootstrap to structure sections.

Suggested layout improvements for better responsiveness.

Use of Gen AI

Tool used: ChatGPT

Purpose: Asked specific questions about Bootstrap syntax and best practices.

Example Prompt: “How do I use Bootstrap grid system to make a two-column layout?”

Reflection: It clarified concepts faster than just reading documentation, but I still verified everything in the official Bootstrap docs.

What I Learned

How Bootstrap helps build responsive websites without writing too much custom CSS.

The difference between containers (container vs container-fluid).

How columns resize depending on screen width using breakpoints (col-md, col-lg).

The importance of consistency in spacing and alignment.

Challenges & Bugs

❌ At first, I struggled to understand how columns stack on smaller screens.
✅ Solved it by testing different breakpoints (col-12, col-md-6) in practice.

❌ Unsure about when to use rows vs. just columns.
✅ Fixed it by checking Bootstrap examples and asking for clarification.

Resources Used

Bootstrap Documentation

Class slides and notes on responsive design

ChatGPT for clarifying Bootstrap concepts

Next Steps

Keep improving the layout of specific sections.

Add placeholder content (text, icons, or images) for testing responsiveness.

Work with the team to unify the color palette and card designs.

Explore Bootstrap components (navbar, buttons, cards) for potential use.

Personal Reflection

Today I focused on learning Bootstrap and applying it to our prototype. At first, it felt a bit confusing, but once I practiced, I saw how powerful it is for creating responsive layouts quickly. Contributing to the design of the prototype helped me understand how theory translates into practice. Using AI for small doubts saved me time, but I made sure to really understand Bootstrap by checking the official docs. I feel more confident about working with Bootstrap in future sessions.

 Build the base structure of the website

 Create a clear and organized HTML skeleton

 Implement navigation (header and footer)

 Design reusable components for content

Tasks Completed

Created the HTML skeleton with the main sections of the site.

What I Learned

How to organize a webpage with a clear skeleton before adding detailed design.

The importance of reusable components (like cards) for consistent layout.

How navigation and footer elements improve user experience.

The balance between structure and design in web development.

Challenges & Bugs

❌ Unsure how to keep sections visually consistent while reusing elements.
✅ Solved by using Bootstrap classes and external CSS styling.

Resources Used

Bootstrap documentation (layout and cards)

Class notes on HTML5 and responsive design

Team feedback on structure

Next Steps

Collaborate on improving the interface with color palette and typography.

Add placeholder content for testing responsiveness.

Explore possible dynamic elements for future iterations.

Personal Reflection

“This session I focused on the structural foundation of our website. Setting up the skeleton, header, and footer gave me a clearer idea of how everything connects. I also enjoyed working on reusable cards, which made the design feel cleaner. While my focus was the base, I’m excited to later explore interface improvements and even some dynamic features.”

Project:  MindCare

Goals for the documented session

 Define the navigation flow of the website

 Research suitable design elements (colors, layout, sections)

 Contribute to interface design for the prototype

 Explore possibilities for the internal structure of the project

Tasks Completed

Investigated what elements would be appropriate to add to the page.

Defined the homepage design with navigation to exercises, breathing tips, and resources.

Designed the interface to include scrolling sections with clear spaces for content.

Selected blue and green as the main colors to reflect peace, calmness, breathing, and oxygen.

Focused on interface design while beginning to consider internal structure possibilities.

Use of Gen AI

Tool used: ChatGPT

Purpose: Asked questions related to Bootstrap layout and best practices.

Reflection: Helped clarify doubts about responsive design but the design work was created directly by me.

What I Learned

The importance of navigation flow in user experience.

How colors can influence the mood and perception of a website.

The balance between simplicity (calm ambience) and functionality.

Early understanding of how the structure (skeleton) supports the final product.

Challenges & Bugs

❌ Difficulty deciding which colors would look professional but also reflect calmness.
✅ Solved by selecting subtle shades of blue and green and balancing with white.

Resources Used

Bootstrap documentation (for layout research)

Color psychology references for UI design

Class notes on HTML structure

Next Steps

Work more on the internal structure of the website.

Test the layout on both wide and mobile views.

Collaborate with the team to integrate interface with content.

Personal Reflection

“This session allowed me to focus on design decisions that directly affect how users will experience our site. Researching colors and navigation gave me a better understanding of how design communicates calmness. While I worked mostly on the interface, I am motivated to also explore the internal structure of the project in future sessions.”
